Kevin Wayne Durant is a professional American basketball player who currently plays for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association. 
  The winner of an NBA Most Valuable Player Award, he has also won two Olympic gold medals. Born in Washington DC in the United States, Durant was enthusiastic about basketball from his childhood.

As a professional basketball player, Durantâ€™s biggest achievement came at the 2012 Olympics where he not only set the record for total points scored in an Olympic basketball tournament, but also helped the national team earn a gold medal.
