    <p class="bio">Stephen Curry is an American professional basketball player who represents the Golden State Warriors in the NBA. He has been named the greatest shooter by many players, as well as analysts, and
       won the 'NBA Most Valuable Player Award' twice in a row, 
      including one unanimous win, a first in NBA history. He led the Warriors to their first championship in four decades, and also helped his team break the record for the most wins in an NBA season.
      Renowned for his shooting skills, he holds the NBA record for most three-pointers made in a regular season, a record that he himself broke twice. He and his teammate, 
      Klay Thompson, are known by the nickname "Splash Brothers" for their record breaking combined three-pointers in a season.</p>
